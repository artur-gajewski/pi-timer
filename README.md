Oven timer for Raspberry Pi
============================

Have you ever wanted to go watch TV while you need to bake something? Have you ever forgotten about the stuff
in the oven and burned it while watching sports?

Why not putting your Raspberry Pi in use and build a LED timer so that next time your buns are in the oven, you
get notified with red or green LEDs about whether the buns are done or not?
